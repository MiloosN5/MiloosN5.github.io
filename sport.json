            "Basketball is a fast-paced and dynamic sport that combines skill, strategy, and teamwork. Invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891, the game has grown into one of the most popular sports worldwide, with professional leagues such as the NBA and EuroLeague attracting millions of fans. Played on a rectangular court with two hoops, the objective is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent’s basket while defending your own.",
            "The sport emphasizes agility, coordination, and precision, making it both exciting to play and watch. With five players per team on the court, basketball requires strong communication and quick decision-making. Over the years, legendary players like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant have elevated the game, inspiring new generations. Whether played casually on street courts or professionally in packed arenas, basketball remains a thrilling and highly competitive sport."
